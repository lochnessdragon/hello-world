# hello-world
First GITHUB repository

I started github because I wanted a place to share my code with the world. And I would like to learn and teach others about new ways and better ways to code. I program in java, python, and c. I hope you find my projects useful and entertaining. You will someday be able to find more about them soon, when my website is complete.
